            The purpose of this service is to help YOU. When you sign up we will pair you with someone from our organization
            who will be your friend and listen to anything you want to talk about and generally be there for you.
            
            Friends <b>ARE</b> people who will listen to your problems without judgement. Talking to a friend is meant to be like,
            well, talking with a friend (that you have yet to meet). They are there to console you, be there when you need them,
            or get chocolate chip ice cream with you (if you're into that kind of thing). To become a friend, our members attend
            a few casual training sessions run by us.
            
            Now that I've told you what a friend can be for you I'd like to tell you what they are not.
            
            Friends <b>ARE NOT</b> a substitute for a professional therapist. They cannot provide any diagnosis and any advice they
            give should be taken with a grain of salt. They are not the end all be all of truth, nor are they god incarnate.
            (If any of them tell you that they are please notify us so we can notify the counseling center.)
            
            Please remember we're all just people and people make mistakes. If you have a shitty encounter with a friend, wheter
            it was their fault or not, please let us know. (There's a nice re-pair button at the bottom of this page that you
            can press if you want to change the person you are talking to and not go through that awkward conversation with them. 
            Though we hope to minimize the awkwardness in this entire experience.) Also, keep in mind our entire 
            process is very new so feedback on changing things would really help us make the entire experience better for you.
            Because in the end, that's why we are doing this. To help YOU in whatever way we can. :)
