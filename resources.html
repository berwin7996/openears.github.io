				Hey, we know it's hard to reach out. We've been there. We appreciate the effort you've made and we'll do the best we can to help you out. In the meantime, here are some resources you can look through that you may find helpful. (or not, but it's here in case)

				<h3>If you want to chat with someone anonymously (and confidentially) online for free:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.7cupsoftea.com/">7 Cups of Tea:</a> Choose to connect with a listener now to talk to someone one on one. This may take a while depending on how busy they are.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.7cupsoftea.com/connect/groupChatrooms.php">7 Cups of Tea (Group Chat):</a> They also have group chatrooms where people with similar problems can talk to one another anonymously.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.crisischat.org/chat/">Lifeline Crisis Chat:</a> Talk one on one to a specialist. They talk about any issues you want, from family proplems to suicidal ideations. Like the others, they are there to listen, not judge, so feel free to talk about what you need to.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.depression-chat-rooms.org/depression-chat.htm">Depression Chat Rooms:</a> They are a community focused on helping people with depression and anxiety, but are happy to help anyone going through hard times.
					</li>
				</ul>

				If you just want to find out more information about how you're feeling, we suggest finding forums online relating to the issues you are dealing with. There are so many helpful communities online. For some of us, a lot of comfort and information was found by reading through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/top/?sort=top&t=month">OCD Subreddit</a>.  It shows that all those weird things we did might not have been just weird things. It helped us relate and realize we're not alone, which is really at the heart of why we want to be there for you right now.
