                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                We are an RSO affiliated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our goal is to be there for people seeking an outlet for their problems and become an informal additive, or for some, alternative to therapy. We hope that our efforts may, in time, lessen the stigma associated with mental illness and seeking help.

                <h2 id="faq_q1" class="faq_q">What do you do?</h2>
                <div id="faq_a1">
                We just want to help people. Many people in our organization have experienced mental turmoil and have felt that they had no one to talk to during that experience. From one of our members:
                <ul>
                <i>
                Personally, at my lowest I felt that anything I would have said to anyone would have just been a burden on them or they would not understand what I was going through. This kept me from saying anything to anyone for some time. But just because that's what I went through does not mean everyone else has to go through that. That's why I'm a part of Open Ears, because I want others to have someone that will be there for them when they experience that. Because no one should have to suffer alone.
                </i>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <h2 id="faq_q2" class="faq_q">That's nice and all, but how are you going to do that?</h2>
                <div id="faq_a2">
                If you want to vent about something to someone we will find you a friend in our RSO. This is someone who will not just act but, we hope, be like a friend to you. Someone who you can just talk to and vent about all the stuff you want to talk about. How that relationship builds and how often you meet and hangout and if you become really good friends is all up to the two individuals. The important thing is that going into that relationship you both talk honestly with each other about what you expect from one another.
                We also want to make groups for people who are suffering from similar ailments such as Depression, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, etc. The difference between talking to someone who has actually experienced those things and people who are just listening and may care but havent been through it are astounding. That is why we want to make communities where people can talk to others who have experienced similar things.
                </div>

                <h2 id="faq_q3" class="faq_q">This is really cool. I want to help. How can I?</h2>
                <div id="faq_a3">
                We would love to have more people help out. We need people to lead groups, talk to people one on one, help with our events, website, etc. <a href="join.html">This</a> link will give more information on things we need help with. But even if you don't get involved with Open Ears, just being more aware of the stigma that mental illnesses carry both in your mind and the people's around you would help us tremendously. Change will not come from us. It will come from everyone, individually deciding to be different. To be better.

                <h2 id="faq_q4" class="faq_q">I think I'd be interested in talking to someone.</h2>
                <div id="faq_a4">
                Awesome! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Bdpq2-4LnSteEkKRGJn8eyqwCdomf0KwRLTh4OMQyCo/viewform?usp=send_form">This</a> link will bring you to a form that will tell us you are interested in talking to someone. You should get an email in a few days. Ideally, it'd be sooner, but we're still working everything out so bear with us. In the meantime, <a href="resources.html">here</a> are some great resources and links to places where you can anonymously and confidentially talk to people online
